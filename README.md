   ```

2. **Or simply open** `index.html` in your web browser

### Content Updates

1. **Company Information** - Update contact details in `index.html`
2. **Services** - Modify the services section to match your offerings
3. **Images** - Replace placeholder images with your own

### Styling

    /* ... */
}
```
